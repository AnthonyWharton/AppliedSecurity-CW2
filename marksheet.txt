1. Instructions

- replace any [...] with free text,
  and
- replace the [?] with an X if you have completed that stage,
- replace the [?] with an * if you have attempted that stage, but you know
  it doesn't work completely; document why you think it doesn't work, plus
  what you would do to fix the problem, at the end of the marksheet.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Information

So that we can calibrate and improve the assignment in the future, give us
a rough idea how long (in hours) you spent on it *in total*:

effort : stage 1 -> 20 hours
effort : stage 2 -> 25 hours
effort : stage 3 -> 24 hours
effort : stage 4 -> 32 hours

3. Citation

Clearly it might have an influence on your mark, but the use of third-party
resources *is* allowed *if* correctly cited (unless explicitly prohibited 
by the assignment description of course).  Let us know what third-party 
source code or resources you used (if any) so it's clear what's your work 
and what isn't:

4. Marking

The following gives a stage-by-stage description of the assignment marking
scheme.  Note this acts as an indicative guideline only, including weights
for each more obvious aspect (e.g., functional correctness); other aspects
outside this list can warrant an increase/decrease in marks, with examples
including hard to quantify features such as the efficiency, robustness, 
generality, realism, or style of a solution.

5. Documentation

Any other documentation, notes or comments that you think are important or
might be easy to overlook (e.g., a subtle issue or technique in associated
source code) should go here:

Stage 1:
    Expected Run Time:
        Around 5 seconds on lab machine with given test files.
    Notes:
        Nothing extraordinary on top of the paper/RFC docs, all documented
        in-file.

Stage 2:
    Expected Run Time:
        Tested on a lab machine, I get anywhere from around 15 seconds with no
        errors being picked up, to up to 45-60 seconds in unlucky cases with 15+
        errors. (With given test files.)
    Notes:
        Error checking was done by comparing the F1-F2 (diff1) and F3-F4 (diff2)
        differences, along with the inequality in the paper. This was by far the
        least effective part of the code, with occasional runs ending up in a
        state of looping errors. In order to combat this, I looked at adapting
        the roll-back code to take this into account.

        I kept an list of positions in the key, and the amount of times we have
        error'd there. This was stored in a recursive doubling approach, as if
        an error occurred at around the same area more than once, it was noted
        that often the error occurred earlier and rolling back further would be
        beneficial.

        On an error, I generated some more samples, looked at the location of
        the error in this array (as well as the bits around it as a sort of
        locality-check) and then rolled back that amount. I used some light
        dynamic programming between rounds, storing the values from the internal
        oracles and using them for the next iteration, however when rolling back
        I regenerated the values. Although it would not be out of reasonable
        bounds to store all previous iterations' computed values, I decided that
        the process of additionally regenerating the precomputed values when
        samples were added was beyond required scope, and would provide little
        additional benefit.

Stage 3:
    Expected Run Time:
        Tested on my local development machine, this attack takes about 1
        second. Lab machines are expected to be slightly slower.
    Notes:
        For this attack I, although only 2 interactions (for a correct and
        faulty execution) are required, I used 4 interactions.  I worked out
        the intersection of the key hypotheses between the two different
        correct/faulty pairs from Stage 1 which usually results in 1 hypothesis
        being fed to stage 2.  This is a drastic reduction in key hypotheses,
        speeding up the attack greatly.  There are occasions where more than 1
        hypothesis is fed into stage 2, thus we still run stage 2 to find the
        correct key hypothesis.

Stage 4:
    Expected Run Time:
        Tested on my local development machine, this attack takes about 20-25
        seconds. Lab machines are expected to be slightly slower, but have
        double the core count and this implementation is threaded, so could
        run faster.
    Notes:
        I finally had to crack out C for this one!

        This should almost always return correct results with the provided
        target, however if it fails self-verification, then it must be re-run.
        If self-verification fails multiple times, the sample size may need to
        be increased. This can be done by changing the definition on line 5
        of attack.c.

        Sadly, due to other deadlines, I decided that the reward/cost ratio of
        implementing automatic scaling of samples, even though fairly trivial,
        was not worth it.
